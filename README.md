# rest-api-iste-workshop
The is the REST API which was used in the AJAX and javascript workshop.

Set up steps:

I) For the MYSQL database:
  - Prerequisites: Make sure you have Ampps installed on your system. (Link: http://www.ampps.com/download)
  - Open PhpMyAdmin and create a new database. 
  - Import heroesdb.sql. Do not forget to **untick** "Do not use AUTO_INCREMENT for zero values".

II) To run the python script:
  - Prerequisites: You must have python 3.6 installed on your system. 
    Also, install these libraries using pip: flask, flask-mysql, flask-restful
  
That's it. Just run the script now. Have fun tinkering with the code!
